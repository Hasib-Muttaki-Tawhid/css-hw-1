    <p><span>F</span>rance has banned Israeli companies from participating in this year’s annual Eurosatory arms and defence industry exhibition 
        in Villepinte near Paris next month, the event’s organisers and French authorities have said.<br><br>

        “By decision of the government authorities, there will be no stand for the Israeli defence industry at the Eurosatory 2024 
        fair,” organisers Coges Events said on Friday.<br><br>

        The French Defence Ministry suggested that the decision was linked to Paris’s opposition to the continuing Israeli assault 
        on Rafah in southern Gaza.<br><br>

        “Conditions are no longer met to host Israeli companies at the show at a time when the President is calling for Israel to 
        cease operations in Rafah,” the ministry told the Reuters news agency.<br><br>

        Seventy-four Israeli firms were set to attend the event from June 17 to 21 at fairgrounds close to Paris’s main international
        airport, with Coges previously saying about 10 of them were to exhibit weapons.<br><br>

        Last week, a group of activists issued a legal warning and urged Coges to take measures to avoid buying and selling weapons 
        that could be used in “crimes” committed in Gaza or other parts of the occupied Palestinian territory.<br><br>
